# STRIPS-HGN
**Update - 21st June 2020**: our re-implementation of STRIPS-HGN is almost ready to go and is currently undergoing testing and experiments. We intend to make it available before the end of June. 

STRIPS-HGN is a framework for learning domain-independent planning heuristics completely from scratch using the hypergraph induced by the delete-relaxation of a STRIPS problem. 

The code for STRIPS-HGN will be made available in the coming months.

Please contact `william.w.y.shen at gmail.com` if the code is still not available at the end of June 2020.
